.. currentModule:: fbupkeep

Basics
======

FBUpkeep is a Python library that provides a task executor engine and a command-line tool to execute tasks. 
Its primary purpose is to run maintenance tasks for `Firebird`_ Â® servers and databases, but could be easily 
extended to run other tasks of various type.

Tasks are simple Python classes inherited from :class:`~base.Task` and registered into `fbupkeep_tasks` `entry point 
group <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#dynamic-discovery-of-services-and-plugins>`_ (in `setup.py`).
Tasks are parameterized by the configuration file (using standard :mod:`configparser` Python library module).

Tasks are managed and executed by :class:`~base.TaskExecutor` which is parametrized using the configuration file and 
options that are typically provided as :class:`argparse.Namespace`.

Module :mod:`fbupkeep.runner` provides `fbupkeep` command-line utility to work with task executor. 

Configuration file
==================

By default, `fbupkeep` uses the :file:`fbupkeep.cfg` configuration file from current working directory, 
but you can specify other file by `-c` or `--config` command-line option.

.. tip::

   `fbupkeep` provides `--create-config` option to create default configuration file for a job.
   
   for example::
   
     fbupkeep --create-config employee.cfg employee
     
   will create file :file:`employee.cfg` for job `employee` (i.e. contains section [upkeep_employee])

File structure
--------------

A configuration file consists of sections, each led by a `[section]` header, followed by
key/value entries separated by `=` or `:` string. Section names are case sensitive but keys
are not. Leading and trailing whitespace is removed from keys and values. Values can be
omitted, in which case the key/value delimiter may also be left out. Values can also
span multiple lines, as long as they are indented deeper than the first line of the value.

.. important::

   FBUpkeep uses named jobs. Each job must have it's own `[upkeep_<jobname>]` section with configuration for task executor 
   and used tasks.

   Individual tasks may use additional sections with their own conventions.

Configuration files may include comments, prefixed by `#` and `;` characters. Comments may
appear on their own on an otherwise empty line, possibly indented.

The DEFAULT section
-------------------

The `DEFAULT` section is a special section. If configuration options is not found in specific section, its looked up
in DEFAULT section, and if foud there, the value defined there is used.

On execution `fbupkeep` script automatically adds next options to the default section::
 
  job_name = [job_name option value]
  here = [current working directory]
  host = [--host option value, default: localhost]
  user = [--user option value, default: 'ISC_USER' env. variable or 'sysdba']
  password = [--password option value, default: 'ISC_PASSWORD' env. variable or 'masterkey']
  output_dir = [--output-dir option value, default: ${here}/${job_name}]
  filename = ${job_name}-%Y%m%d

You can freely use these options for interpolation in your configuration.

If you define any from these options in default section, its value would be ignored
(replaced by command-line option value).

Interpolation
-------------

Values can contain `${section:option}` format strings which refer to other values.
If the `section:` part is omitted, interpolation defaults to the current section (and possibly
the default values from the special `DEFAULT` section). Interpolation can span multiple levels.

For example::

   [My Section]
   foodir: ${dir}/whatever
   dir=frob
   long: this value continues
      in the next line

would resolve the `${dir}` to the value of `dir` (`frob` in this case). All reference expansions are done on demand.
